## Basics

* Everything is an object

    ```Ruby
    p 1.methods
    p 2.between? 1,3
    p 2.even?
    p 1+2
    p 1.+(2)
    p 3 == 3
    ```

## Variables

* Types

     ```Ruby
     name = 'Daniel'   # Strings
     age = 42          # Integer
     weight = 89.9     # Float
     is_tall = true    # Boolean
     ```

* Calculations

     ```Ruby
    puts 2 * 3        # Basic Arithmetic: +, -, /, *
    puts 2**3         # Expoent
    puts 10 % 3       # Modulus
    puts 1 + 2 * 3    # Order of operation
    puts 10 / 3       # Float
     ```

* Iteration with +=, -=, /=, *=

     ```Ruby
     num = 1
     num += 10
     ```

* Setting values

    ```Ruby
    sum = 1 + 2
    a, b = 1, 2
    name = 'Daniel'
    res = 1 > 2 ? true : false
    c, d, e = [1, 2, 3]
    ```


## Strings

* Basics

    ```Ruby
    greeting = 'Hello Ruby'

    puts greeting.size
    puts greeting[0]
    puts greeting.include? 'Ruby'
    puts greeting[1, 3]
    puts greeting[-1, -4]
    ```

* Interpolation

    ```Ruby
    a = 1
    b = 4
    puts "The number #{a} is less than #{b}"
    ```

* Search in strings

    ```Ruby
    "[Luke:] I can’t believe it. [Yoda:] That is why you fail.".include? 'Yoda'
    "Ruby is a beautiful language".start_with? 'Ruby'
    "I can't work with any other language but Ruby".end_with? 'Ruby'
    "I am a Rubyist".index 'R'
    ```

* Replace

    ```Ruby
    "I should look into your problem when I get time".sub('I','We')
    "I should look into your problem when I get time".gsub('I','We')
    'RubyIsGreat'.gsub(/[aeiou]/,'1')
    'Ruby Is Pretty Brilliant'.gsub /[A-Z]/, '0'
    ```

## Loops

* Annotations should usually be written on the line immediately above
  the relevant code.
* The annotation keyword is followed by a colon and a space, then a note
  describing the problem.
* If multiple lines are required to describe the problem, subsequent
  lines should be indented two spaces after the `#`.

    ```Ruby
    def bar
      # FIXME: This has crashed occasionally since v3.2.1. It may
      #   be related to the BarBazUtil upgrade.
      baz(:quux)
    end
    ```

* In cases where the problem is so obvious that any documentation would
  be redundant, annotations may be left at the end of the offending line
  with no note. This usage should be the exception and not the rule.

    ```Ruby
    def bar
      sleep 100 # OPTIMIZE
    end
    ```

* Use `TODO` to note missing features or functionality that should be
  added at a later date.
* Use `FIXME` to note broken code that needs to be fixed.
* Use `OPTIMIZE` to note slow or inefficient code that may cause
  performance problems.
* Use `HACK` to note code smells where questionable coding practices
  were used and should be refactored away.
* Use `REVIEW` to note anything that should be looked at to confirm it
  is working as intended. For example: `REVIEW: Are we sure this is how the
  client does X currently?`
* Use other custom annotation keywords if it feels appropriate, but be
  sure to document them in your project's `README` or similar.

## Arrays

* When designing class hierarchies make sure that they conform to the
  [Liskov Substitution Principle](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Liskov_substitution_principle).
* Try to make your classes as
  [SOLID](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOLID_(object-oriented_design\))
  as possible.
* Always supply a proper `to_s` method for classes that represent
  domain objects.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end

      def to_s
        "#@first_name #@last_name"
      end
    end
    ```

* Use the `attr` family of functions to define trivial accessors or
mutators.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class Person
      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end

      def first_name
        @first_name
      end

      def last_name
        @last_name
      end
    end

    # good
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end
    end
    ```
* Consider using `Struct.new`, which defines the trivial accessors,
constructor and comparison operators for you.

    ```Ruby
    # good
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end
    end

    # better
    class Person < Struct.new(:first_name, :last_name)
    end
    ````

* Consider adding factory methods to provide additional sensible ways
to create instances of a particular class.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      def self.create(options_hash)
        # body omitted
      end
    end
    ```

* Prefer [duck-typing](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Duck_typing) over inheritance.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    class Animal
      # abstract method
      def speak
      end
    end

    # extend superclass
    class Duck < Animal
      def speak
        puts 'Quack! Quack'
      end
    end

    # extend superclass
    class Dog < Animal
      def speak
        puts 'Bau! Bau!'
      end
    end

    # good
    class Duck
      def speak
        puts 'Quack! Quack'
      end
    end

    class Dog
      def speak
        puts 'Bau! Bau!'
      end
    end
    ```

* Avoid the usage of class (`@@`) variables due to their "nasty" behavior
in inheritance.

    ```Ruby
    class Parent
      @@class_var = 'parent'

      def self.print_class_var
        puts @@class_var
      end
    end

    class Child < Parent
      @@class_var = 'child'
    end

    Parent.print_class_var # => will print "child"
    ```

    As you can see all the classes in a class hierarchy actually share one
    class variable. Class instance variables should usually be preferred
    over class variables.

* Assign proper visibility levels to methods (`private`, `protected`)
in accordance with their intended usage. Don't go off leaving
everything `public` (which is the default). After all we're coding
in *Ruby* now, not in *Python*.
* Indent the `public`, `protected`, and `private` methods as much the
  method definitions they apply to. Leave one blank line above them.

    ```Ruby
    class SomeClass
      def public_method
        # ...
      end

      private
      def private_method
        # ...
      end
    end

* Use `def self.method` to define singleton methods. This makes the methods
  more resistant to refactoring changes.

    ```Ruby
    class TestClass
      # bad
      def TestClass.some_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # good
      def self.some_other_method
        # body omitted
      end

      # Also possible and convenient when you
      # have to define many singleton methods.
      class << self
        def first_method
          # body omitted
        end

        def second_method_etc
          # body omitted
        end
      end
    end
    ```

## Hashes

* Signal exceptions using the `fail` keyword. Use `raise` only when
  catching an exception and re-raising it (because here you're not failing, but explicitly and purposefully raising an exception).

    ```Ruby
    begin
      fail 'Oops';
    rescue => error
      raise if error.message != 'Oops'
    end
    ```

* Never return form an `ensure` block. If you explicitly return from a
  method inside an `ensure` block, the return will take precedence over
  any exception being raised, and the method will return as if no
  exception had been raised at all. In effect, the exception will be
  silently thrown away.

    ```Ruby
    def foo
      begin
        fail
      ensure
        return 'very bad idea'
      end
    end
    ```

* Use *implicit begin blocks* when possible.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    def foo
      begin
        # main logic goes here
      rescue
        # failure handling goes here
      end
    end

    # good
    def foo
      # main logic goes here
    rescue
      # failure handling goes here
    end
    ```

* Mitigate the proliferation of `begin` blocks via the use of
  *contingency methods* (a term coined by Avdi Grimm).

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      something_that_might_fail
    rescue IOError
      # handle IOError
    end

    begin
      something_else_that_might_fail
    rescue IOError
      # handle IOError
    end

    # good
    def with_io_error_handling
       yield
    rescue
      # handle IOError
    end

    with_io_error_handling { something_that_might_fail }

    with_io_error_handling { something_else_that_might_fail }
    ```

* Don't suppress exceptions.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # an exception occurs here
    rescue SomeError
      # the rescue clause does absolutely nothing
    end

    # bad
    do_something rescue nil
    ```

* Don't use exceptions for flow of control.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      n / d
    rescue ZeroDivisionError
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    end

    # good
    if d.zero?
      puts 'Cannot divide by 0!'
    else
      n / d
    end
    ```

* Avoid rescuing the `Exception` class.  This will trap signals and calls to
  `exit`, requiring you to `kill -9` the process.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # calls to exit and kill signals will be caught (except kill -9)
      exit
    rescue Exception
      puts "you didn't really want to exit, right?"
      # exception handling
    end

    # good
    begin
      # a blind rescue rescues from StandardError, not Exception as many
      # programmers assume.
    rescue => e
      # exception handling
    end

    # also good
    begin
      # an exception occurs here

    rescue StandardError => e
      # exception handling
    end

    ```

* Put more specific exceptions higher up the rescue chain, otherwise
  they'll never be rescued from.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    begin
      # some code
    rescue Exception => e
      # some handling
    rescue StandardError => e
      # some handling
    end

    # good
    begin
      # some code
    rescue StandardError => e
      # some handling
    rescue Exception => e
      # some handling
    end
    ```

* Release external resources obtained by your program in an ensure
block.

    ```Ruby
    f = File.open('testfile')
    begin
      # .. process
    rescue
      # .. handle error
    ensure
      f.close unless f.nil?
    end
    ```

* Favor the use of exceptions for the standard library over
introducing new exception classes.

## Classes

* Prefer literal array and hash creation notation (unless you need to
pass parameters to their constructors, that is).

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    arr = Array.new
    hash = Hash.new

    # good
    arr = []
    hash = {}
    ```

* Prefer `%w` to the literal array syntax when you need an array of
strings.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    STATES = ['draft', 'open', 'closed']

    # good
    STATES = %w(draft open closed)
    ```

* Avoid the creation of huge gaps in arrays.

    ```Ruby
    arr = []
    arr[100] = 1 # now you have an array with lots of nils
    ```

* Use `Set` instead of `Array` when dealing with unique elements. `Set`
  implements a collection of unordered values with no duplicates. This
  is a hybrid of `Array`'s intuitive inter-operation facilities and
  `Hash`'s fast lookup.
* Use symbols instead of strings as hash keys.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { 'one' => 1, 'two' => 2, 'three' => 3 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
    ```

* Avoid the use of mutable object as hash keys.
* Use the new 1.9 literal hash syntax in preference to the hashrocket
syntax.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    hash = { :one => 1, :two => 2, :three => 3 }

    # good
    hash = { one: 1, two: 2, three: 3 }
    ```

* Rely on the fact that hashes in 1.9 are ordered.
* Never modify a collection while traversing it.

## Methods

* Prefer string interpolation instead of string concatenation:

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    email_with_name = user.name + ' <' + user.email + '>'

    # good
    email_with_name = "#{user.name} <#{user.email}>"
    ```

* Consider padding string interpolation code with space. It more clearly sets the
  code apart from the string.

    ```Ruby
    "#{ user.last_name }, #{ user.first_name }"
    ```

* Prefer single-quoted strings when you don't need string interpolation or
  special symbols such as `\t`, `\n`, `'`, etc.

    ```Ruby
    # bad
    name = "Bozhidar"

    # good
    name = 'Bozhidar'
    ```

* Don't use `{}` around instance variables being interpolated into a
  string.

    ```Ruby
    class Person
      attr_reader :first_name, :last_name

      def initialize(first_name, last_name)
        @first_name = first_name
        @last_name = last_name
      end

      # bad
      def to_s
        "#{@first_name} #{@last_name}"
      end

      # good
      def to_s
        "#@first_name #@last_name"
      end
    end
    ```

* Avoid using `String#+` when you need to construct large data chunks.
  Instead, use `String#<<`. Concatenation mutates the string instance in-place
  and is always faster than `String#+`, which creates a bunch of new string objects.

    ```Ruby
    # good and also fast
    html = ''
    html << '<h1>Page title</h1>'

    paragraphs.each do |paragraph|
      html << "<p>#{paragraph}</p>"
    end
    ```
